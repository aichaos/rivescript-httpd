<h1>No Suitable Interpreter Found</h1>

This CGI script couldn't be executed because you don't have the appropriate
interpreter installed on your computer. The script wanted to use
<code>[% interpreter %]</code>, but the interpreter wasn't found at that path.

<h2>What can I do?</h2>

[% IF interpreter.match(".*python.*") %]
	It looks like this is a <strong>Python</strong> script!<p>

	You can download Python from <a href="http://python.org/">Python.org</a> and
	install it on your computer. If you're on Windows, it will probably install
	to a path like <code>C:\Python27\python.exe</code>, and Python scripts should
	start working on this web server after it's installed.<p>

	If you installed Python and you still can't run this CGI script, send an e-mail
	to <a href="https://github.com/kirsle">Kirsle</a> about it. Chances are it's
	because a newer version of Python was released and it has a new path on your
	hard drive that the current version of RiveScript::HTTPd isn't programmed to
	look out for.
[% ELSE %]
	This doesn't appear to be either a Perl or a Python script. This web server
	is only designed to support Perl and Python, so running CGI scripts from
	other programming languages is not officially supported.

	If you're sure you have the correct interpreter installed, edit the file
	<code>[% file %]</code> in a text editor and change the first line to
	point to the correct path to the interpreter.
[% END %]
