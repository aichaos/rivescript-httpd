	<h1>Refreshing the File List</h1>

	<strong>Why do I need to refresh the file list?</strong><p>

	(NOTE: This is only for the JavaScript front-end to RiveScript)<p>

	Unlike Perl and Python, which are both capable of opening up a folder and
	looking at all the files inside, JavaScript can only access files by
	knowing exactly where to find them. Because of this, you can't tell the
	JavaScript version to just "look at my 'brain' folder" like you can with
	Perl and Python; instead, JavaScript needs to be given a list of <em>all
	the files</em> that exist inside that folder.<p>

	The RiveScript::HTTPd site provides a tool to help you with this
	automatically. From the home page, just click on the "Refresh the
	File List" button under the JavaScript section. This tool will generate
	a file named "brain.js" inside the "public_html/js" folder, which will
	tell the JavaScript client what files are in the "brain" folder.<p>

	If you add or delete RiveScript files from the "brain" folder, be sure
	to refresh the file list so that the JavaScript code will know about
	what's been changed!<p>
