	<h1>Welcome!</h1>

	If you're seeing this page, it means that RiveScript::HTTPd seems to be
	working! RiveScript::HTTPd is a simple web server for quickly
	getting started with RiveScript chatbot development!<p>

	This server is only for <em>your</em> development and testing purposes.
	It is not meant to be publically accessible to the world. By default the
	server only listens on your local loopback address (<code>127.0.0.1</code>).
	When you've got your chatbot configured how you like it, you can upload
	it and one of the CGI scripts to a web host and let the world see it. If
	your web host doesn't allow you to run neither Perl nor Python CGI scripts,
	you can upload the JavaScript version instead!
	<a href="help/index.html">Learn more</a>

	<h2>Test Your Bot</h2>

	You can have a conversation with your RiveScript bot in a variety of
	different ways.<p>

	<table class="fifty">

			<th>Client Side JavaScript</th>

				These chat interfaces rely on server side scripting technology.
				There are Perl and Python versions available. When you're satisfied
				with your bot and want to allow people on the Internet to chat with
				it, you can upload the CGI scripts from your <code>public_html</code>
				folder to your web host. <a href="help/publish.html">How do I
				publish my bot?</a>

				<h3>Perl</h3>

				If you have a Perl interpreter installed on your computer, this CGI
				script will use that. Otherwise, this web server will run this script.<p>

				<a class="button" href="rivescript.pl" target="_blank">
					Perl CGI
				</a>

				<h3>Python</h3>

				You will require a Python interpreter to run this CGI script from
				your computer.<p>

				<a class="button" href="rivescript.py" target="_blank">
					Python CGI</a>
			</td>
			<td>
				The JavaScript version of RiveScript can be run completely from
				within your web browser. If you want to upload your bot to your
				web host but they don't allow you to run Perl or Python CGI scripts,
				you can upload the JavaScript chat page instead.

				<h3>JavaScript</h3>

				After you edit your RiveScript code, you'll need to "refresh" the
				JavaScript file list. To do that, click on the Refresh link below.
				Make sure you remember to refresh the file list before you (re)
				upload your bot to your web host! <a href="help/refresh.html">Why
				do I need to do this?</a><p>

	<h2>Edit Your Bot</h2>

	To edit your bot's replies, open the <code>public_html</code> folder in your
	RiveScript::HTTPd directory and then open the <code>brain</code> folder. The
	replies are stored within <code>*.rs</code> files.<p>

	By default, RiveScript::HTTPd comes with the standard demo brain that includes
	a lot of Eliza-like responses. You can open these files in a text editor such
	as Notepad to begin editing replies. After saving the changes, reload the chat
	page in your web browser to reload the bot. If you add new files, you'll need
	to refresh the file list for the JavaScript version to get updated.
