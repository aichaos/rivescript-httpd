<h1>No Suitable Interpreter Found</h1>

This CGI script couldn't be executed because you don't have the appropriate
interpreter installed on your computer.

<h2>What can I do?</h2>

If this URL ends with ".py", it's probably a <strong>Python</strong> script!
You can download Python from <a href="http://python.org/">Python.org</a> and
install it on your computer. If you're on Windows, it will probably install to
a path like <code>C:\Python27\python.exe</code>, and Python scripts should start
working on this web server after it's installed.<p>

If the URL ends with ".pl", it's probably a <strong>Perl</strong> script!
You can download Perl from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl">
ActivePerl.com</a> and install it on your computer. If you're on Windows, it will
probably install to a path like <code>C:\Perl</code>, and Perl scripts should
start working on this web server after it's installed.
